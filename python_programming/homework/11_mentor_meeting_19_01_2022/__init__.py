# 1. Write a function that prints all duplicate items from a given list
​
# Input: [10, 20, 30, 30, 60, 40, 30, 60, 70, 80]
# Expected Output: -
#
# [20, 30, 60]
​
​
# 2.Write a program to find nth fibonacci number with recursion?
# A Fibonacci series is a series in which next number is a sum of previous two numbers.
#
# For example : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
# First Fibonacci number is 0, second is 1, third is 2 and etc.
# Input: fib(2)
# Output: 1
#After implemetation of this task: Write a Python program to check if a given number is a Fibonacci number or not.
#Input: 8
#Output: True
​
# 3. Write a program to iterate a given list and count the occurrence of each element and create a dictionary to show the count of each element.
​
# Input : [11, 45, 8, 11, 23, 45, 23, 45, 89]
# Output : {11: 2, 45: 3, 8: 1, 23: 2, 89: 1}
​
​
# 4. Write a function. For a given sentence, return the average word length.
# Note: Remember to remove punctuation first.
​
# sentence1 = "Hi all, my name is Tom...I am originally from Australia."
# sentence2 = "I need to work very hard to learn more about algorithms in Python!"
​
# Output:
# 4.2
# 4.08
​
# 5. Write a program that check given an array of integers is monotonic or not.
# A = [6, 5, 4, 4]
# B = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]
# C = [1, 1, 2, 3, 7]
# Output:
# True
# False
# True

​
# 7. Write a python program to find h.c.f. of two numbers
#
# For any two numbers that are inputs given by the user, we have to calculate and print the h.c.f. of that numbers.
# Case1: If the user inputs the numbers 4 and 6.
#
#
#             then the output should be ‘2’.
#
# Case2: If the user inputs the numbers 5 and 7.
#
#             then the output should be ‘1’.
​
# 8 . Write a Python program to find l.c.m. of two numbers
# For any two numbers given by the user as an input, we have to calculate and print the l.c.m. of that numbers using python programming language.
# Case1: If the user inputs the numbers 4 and 6.
#
#              then the output should be ‘12’.
#
# Case2: If the user inputs the numbers 5 and 7.
#
#             then the output should be ‘35’.

# 9. Write a Python function that takes a list of words and return the longest word and the length of the longest one.

# Input: ["Python", "Exercises", "Great"]
# Output:
# Longest word:  Exercises
# Length of the longest word:  9
