# Problem: Sofia Marathon

# For the purposes of processing the results of the Sofia Marathon, the following classes must be described:

# Class Time, representing time in hours, minutes, and seconds - integers. The class must have:
# -- constructors, method __str__()
# -- method time_diff, you find the difference between the current time and the time "t" 
# passed by the argument

# Class Competitor, presenting the following data for a competitor: registration number(1-1000), 
# name, last name, starting time
# (in a marathon, competitors do not always start together), time of reaching the finish line. The class must have:
# -- constructors, method __str__()
# -- Method __str__() must output the race time information of the participant in a formatted form in the form of a table
#  (the table must contain all information about the participants in a formatted form)

# A test script demonstrating the behavior of the classes and the interaction between them. (main.py)
